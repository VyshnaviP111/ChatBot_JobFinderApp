      "\n",
      "Job Finder was created to give job‑seekers in the United States a **fast, clean, and trustworthy way to find real work**—whether they’re looking for contract, full‑time, part‑time, or remote positions.  \n",
      "\n",
      "| The pain points people face today | How Job Finder solves them |\n",
      "|-----------------------------------|----------------------------|\n",
      "| **Stale or duplicate listings** – many job boards refresh only once a day or show the same posting dozens of times. | **Real‑time updates** every 30 minutes and automatic duplicate removal keep the feed fresh and concise. |\n",
      "| **Fake or scam postings** – endless spam, “too‑good‑to‑be‑true” offers, and non‑US jobs clutter the search. | **AI‑driven filtering** strips out scam‑like and non‑US listings, so you only see legitimate U.S. opportunities. |\n",
      "| **Time‑consuming manual filtering** – you have to sift by location, experience, visa status, etc., on every site. | **Smart job filtering** lets you narrow results by skills, job title, location (remote/onsite), experience level, visa needs (OPT/H‑1B), and contract type—all in one place. |\n",
      "| **No personalized match** – generic job boards don’t consider your unique skill set or career preferences. | **Personalized recommendations** are generated from the profile you build (skills, technologies, experience, preferred job type/location). |\n",
      "| **Tracking applications is chaotic** – you lose track of where you’ve applied, interview dates, or follow‑ups. | **Job Tracker Dashboard** lets you save jobs, mark applications, schedule interviews, and monitor rejections or follow‑ups in one view. |\n",
      "| **Resume isn’t leveraged** – many sites ignore the content of your resume when matching jobs. | **Resume upload (PDF/DOCX)** feeds the AI additional data, improving match quality. |\n",
      "| **Cost barriers** – premium job‑search tools charge for basic features. | **Completely free** for all users, with no hidden fees or premium tiers. |\n",
      "\n",
      "In short, **Job Finder exists to eliminate the noise, speed up the search, and give every U.S. job‑seeker a reliable, AI‑powered platform that matches the right opportunities to the right people—without cost or hassle.**  \n",
      "\n",
      "If you’d like to see how it works for your specific profile, just let me know your skills, preferred job type, and location, and I can walk you through the next steps!\n",
      "**Yes – Job Finder can surface H‑1B‑friendly positions.**  \n",
      "\n",
      "When you set up your profile (or later in the filter panel) you’ll see a **“Visa needs”** option. Select **“H‑1B‑friendly”** (or “OPT / H‑1B”) and the engine will:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Pull only U.S. postings** that explicitly mention sponsorship, H‑1B eligibility, or are posted by companies known to sponsor visas.  \n",
      "2. **Exclude** listings that state “no sponsorship” or that are clearly not open to visa holders.  \n",
      "3. **Rank** those jobs higher in your personalized recommendation feed, so the most relevant H‑1B opportunities appear first.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can combine this filter with any other criteria you like—skill set, location (remote/on‑site), contract type, experience level, etc.—and the results will update in real‑time (every 30 minutes).\n",
      "\n",
      "**How to enable it**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Create / edit your profile** → add your skills, experience, and indicate that you need H‑1B sponsorship.  \n",
      "2. **In the job‑search UI**, open the filter sidebar and tick **“H‑1B‑friendly”** under *Visa needs*.  \n",
      "3. **Hit “Apply Filters.”** The list refreshes instantly with only those roles that match your visa requirement.\n",
